<h3>Notes about the 2019 changes to ALH</h3>

<p>I have made changes to ALH which diverge from the original design of ALH. I added features which rely for a large part on details about how Atlantis works. One such component is the routeplanner, which can calculate how long it takes for a unit to travel from its current location to its destination. This takes properties of the terrain, roads and weather into account. It does not support the atlantis v5 'queued up' movement points yet. It can also create a move order with the fastest path to the destination for you, see the $move <a href="#pseudocomments">Pseudocommand</a>.</p>

<p>As ALH is now aware where units are going, as a convenience the destination hex will show the <b>arriving units</b> in the unit list at the bottom, with a yellow background color. You can issue orders to them, regardless of whether you have the departure or the arrival hex selected. Units which are leaving a hex have a blue color, and guards have a brown color. Note - a unit may need more than one turn to arrive at its destination. It will not show in hexes along the route.</p>

<p>If ALH knows how shafts are connected it can predict movements to the underworld. ALH learns this when one of your units travels through a shaft. If you know how shafts are connected and want to tell ALH this, you can use the <b>connect shafts</b> option from the menu.</p>

<p>Another major change is that <b>new units</b>, such as NEW 1, are no longer transient. They keep exisiting even after you select another hex to look at. Instead of typing the FORM X command in the orders for another unit, ALH does this for you. Right click on the unit which should create the new unit and select "Split". In the Split Unit dialog you can directly give items from the original unit to the new one and issue orders for the new unit. After splitting, you can select the new unit and modify its orders. Repeated @FORM no longer works.</p>

<p>Another feature is the economy prediction. ALH is quite good at predicting how much silver a unit will have during the various phases when the turn runs. It will calculate how much silver a unit will tax for, its study costs, which units will share silver if you use the SHARE 1 flag, and whether a unit will have enough maintenance silver to survive the maintenance phase. You can activate these options in the <b>Economy Menu</b>; when you start ALH they are always off.</p>

<p>Feedback is welcome, you can leave me a message on discord @Zorky#3892 or erwin@bridgebar.nl. </p>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	Atlantis Little Helper (ALH) is a client application for Atlantis PBEM game. It
	is simple and it is intended to be as much compatible with different varieties
	of Atlantis 4 as possible.
	<li>
	There were two design goals for ALH - simplicity and compatibility. ALH is not
	overloaded with controls, it parses reports as little as possible and it is not
	pretending to know everything about Atlantis ruleset. So new items, skills and
	such would not cause it to crash.
	<li>
	ALH is an Open Source project. It is cross-platform (Windows/Unix/Mac), at
	least it was tested on Linux and Windows.
	<li>ALH is available as source code and as compiled Windows and Linux binaries. 
</ul>

<a name="installconfig"></a>
<h3>Installation and configuration</h3>
<ul>
	<a name="compiling"></a>
	<h4>Compiling the sources</h4>
	ALH has been succesfully compiled on win32, Linux GTK, Mac OS X&nbsp;platforms.
	<br>
	&nbsp;
	<li>Install wxWidgets GUI Library. If it is not in you distribution, download from <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">
			www.wxwidgets.org</a>. Versions 2.4.x, 2.6.x work fine. You will need both base system and development
	files.
	<li>If you want Python support, install Python (available from <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>).
	Again, both base system and development files are needed. 
	<li>For win32 platform, set WX2 evironment variable to the path you have installed
	wxWidgets into and PY24 to the Python's installation path. Then use ah.dsp file
	for VC++ compiler.
	<li>On *nux run
<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>
	<p>
	<a name="install"></a>
	<h4>Installation</h4>
	<li>ALH uses current directory for storing configuration and history files. So, you
	will need a separate directory for every game you are playing. And that
	directory must be a current directory when you are starting ALH.
	<li>Just copy ALH executable to some directory on the path and run it from the game
		directory.
		<p>
			<a name="install_win32"></a>
			<h4>Installation on Windows</h4>
	<li>ALH uses current directory for storing configuration and history files. So, you
	will need a separate directory for every game you are playing. And that
	directory must be a current directory when you are starting ALH. The simplest
	way to do it is just to copy ah.exe in every game directory. Or desktop
	shortcut may be created for each game, starting directory set to point to your
	game directory. And so on.
	<li>Windows file extension association may be created, so you will just have to
	click on a report file to run ALH. If you placed ALH into, say, d:\bin, then
	use the next line for "Application used to perform action" when creating an
	association: d:\bin\ah.exe "%1" This is yet another way to handle the current
	directory requirement.
	<p>
		<a name="config"></a>
		<h4>Configuration</h4>
	<li>
		ALH stores configuration data in two files:
		<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 20px">
			ah.cfg contains client configuration, such as windows positions and sizes.<br>
			ah.st.cfg contains game specific data, such as item descriptions or report file
			names.<br>
		</div>
	<li>
	There are user interfaces for the most common configuration tasks. For example,
	fonts and colors can be changed from Menu/View/Options. Column sets in the unit
	lists can be modified from Menu/Windows/List Columns/...
	<li>
		Config files can be modified manually as well. <a name="config_sections"></a>
	<li>
		Config file sections of interest are:
					<pre>    [ALIASES]        - In this section aliases must be in underscored
			form, like Horse_Training. In orders both forms
			are valid, so it ok to write "Horse Training"
			as well.
format:
    alias  = name


    [COMMON]         - common settings
values:
    HEX_SIZE_LIST    - comma separated list of hex sizes
    MEN_THRESHOLD    - if number of your men in a hex is bigger then

    sequence  = width, flags, <a href="#unitprop">property</a>, column_name

    sequence    - order in which columns will appear in the unit list
    width       - column width, easily changed with a mouse :)
    flags       - 0 for left alignment, 1 for right alignment
    property    - <a href="#unitprop">property</a> name, alias or group name
    column_name - display name for the column


    [UNIT_PROPERTY_GROUPS] - unit <a href="#unitprop">property</a> groups which can be displayed
                            in the unit list as columns

    [PLANE_SIZE] - ah.st.cfg. When you know the dimensions of your world, enter
                   them and ALH can use them to wrap the map before you explore
                   the edge. Syntax: plane_name = x-min,y-min,x-max,y-max. 
                   For example:
        [PLANE_SIZE]
        Overworld  = 0,0,29,29
        underworld = 0,0,9,9

</pre>
	<a name="unitprop"></a>
	<h3>Unit properties</h3>
	<li>Units have properties. Every item unit posess or skill it has is a property.
	Short form of an item/skill name is a property name. Undescore is appended to a
	skill name to distinguish it from an item name. For example, HORS property
	specifies how many horses unit has and HORS_ specifies unit's skill level in
	horse training.
	<li>Unit properties are used to display units in the lists and process orders.
	<li>Underscores are only used for unit's skill properties, in orders skill names
	are used as usual!
	<li>Built-in unit properties are:
	<pre>    id                - unit id
    name              - unit name
    description       - full unit description
    factionid         - faction id
    faction           - faction name
    landid            - id of region the unit is in
    structid          - id of a structure the unit is inside
    structowner       - is unit an owner of a structure?
    structname        - name of a structure the unit is inside
    comments          - the first comment line of default orders/comments
                        pane (the first character of a comment line is ';')
    orders            - orders
    teaching          - shows how many students per teacher this unit is
                        teaching (rounded up), or how many days of
                        teaching the unit receives (rounded down).
    weight            - unit's weight.
    movement          - movement mode.
    sequence          - report's order of units.
    flags_standard    - standard unit flags, condensed into string.
    flags_custom      - custom unit flags, comma-separated.
    flags_custom_abbr - custom unit flags, numbers condensed into string.
</pre>
	<li>It is possible to assign an <a href="#config_sections">alias</a>
	to a property name. Default aliases are defined based on 4.0.4 source code.
	Aliases are not deducted from the report, they are read from the config file!
	<li>Properties can be combined into <a href="#config_sections">groups</a>
	in the [UNIT_PROPERTY_GROUPS] section.
	<li>When defining a group, only property names can be used. Aliases and groups are
		disabled here since they slow down display significantly. 
<a name="play"></a>
		<h3>Features and Playing</h3>
	<li>ALH accepts report file name as a command line parameter.
	<li>ALH processes GIVE, BUY, SELL, FORM, STUDY, TEACH, CLAIM, LEAVE, ENTER,
	PROMOTE, MOVE, SAIL, ADVANCE, TURN/ENDTURN, ATTACK, ASSASSINATE, STEAL, GUARD,
	AVOID, BEHIND, REVEAL, HOLD, NOAID, CONSUME, NOCROSS, TAX, AUTOTAX orders.
	<li>Try right-clicking and double-clicking everywhere! There are many actions
	performed this way. For example, double-clicking in the Errors and Messages
	window will select a corresponding unit and/or hex.
	<li>There are hotkeys to make writing orders easier while in the same hex:
	<br>Ctrl-U  goto Unit list
	<br>Ctrl-O  goto Orders pane
	<br>Ctrl-N  select next unit (while focus stays the same pane)
	<br>Ctrl-P  select previous unit (while focus stays the same pane)
	<br>If the split-unit dialog has focus, Ctrl-Enter/Return activates the submit button.
	<li>
	ALH may become confused when a new plane appears in a report. In this case just
	click a couple of times on plane switching/centering buttons and everything
	will be back to normal.
	<li>
		In the reports regions' X and Y coordinates must be in the range [-2048 ..
		2047], maximum number of planes is 256. Faction and unit ids must not exceed 65535.
			
			
<a name="map_legend"></a>
	<h4>Map Legend</h4>
	<li>
	There is a number of icons which could be displayed in the map:
	<li>
	'$' specifies taxed regions.
	<li>
	'P' specifies regions with production activities.
	<li>
	Pyramid represents a generic object.
	<li>
	Inverted Pyramid is a ship.
	<li>
	Ladder is a shaft.
	<li>
	A square with hole in it is a gate.
	<li>
		Line is a road. A bad road is dashed line or thin line. Dashing does not work
		on Windows. <a name="map_bimaps"></a>
		<h4>Use bitmaps to display terrains</h4>
	<li>
	Get a set of windows bitmap files you want to use for the terrain. File names
	must correspond to terrains, for example bitmap for forest must be called
	'forest.bmp'.
	<li>
		Place bitmaps into your game folder. <a name="ally"></a>
		<h4>Alliance support</h4>
	<li>
	Allies' reports can be joined to the player's report. It will combine
	visibility of units, hexes and such.
	<li>
	Allies' units can be given orders just like player's units.
	<li>
	Joining can be done through Menu/File/Join or all the reports can be given in
	the command line.
	<li>
	Map fragments can be joined as well. Of course, map fragments must be in the
	natural format, the one used in the reports!

	<li>
	Map fragments can be exported as well. It is possible to drag mouse on the map
	selecting an area, and then export that area. <a name="python"></a>

		<h4>Pseudocomments (special abilities)</h4>
		<a name="pseudocomments"></a>
	Pseudocomments are special comments which allow to modify the way how a command
	in the orders is executed. <br>
	The following pseudocommands are supported: <br><br>
	<li>
	$ne - ignore warnings and errors. If error happens, it
	will affect the command as usual, however, no indication of the error will be given. <br>
	For example, <br><br>
	@give 123 all iron ;$ne<br><br>
	will not keep annoying you if unit 123 does not have any iron.

	<li>
	$get N itemname - will get N items. N can be negative.
	Useful when ALH does not know about side effects of some commands, such as price of casting a spell. Example:<br><br>
	cast Magic_Shoe_Making ;$get -100 silv<br><br>

	<li>
	;$move &lt;location&gt; 
	<br>If the unit does not have a move order, ALH will create a move order for the unit to go to the specified location. Location can be specified by coordinates or by settlement name.<br>
	<li>;$checkzero &lt;item&gt;
	<br>Creates warning if unit has 'item'. Using a category such as 'stuff' works. Useful for checking that a caravan unit fully offloads all of its cargo. It is easy to forget that your iron mine suddenly gives mithril to your transport and forget to offload.
	<li>;$upkeep &lt;X&gt; 
	<br>deducts X turns of upkeep.
	<li>;$travel &lt; walk | ride | fly &gt; 
	<br>ALH by default will issue a warning if a unit tries to move further than it can travel in one turn.<br>
	You can suppress any warnings by adding ';ne' to the move order, but the next turn it probably comes back when on a lenghty journey. The travel command will suppress warnings about multi-turn movement, and creates a warning if the unit cannot move at the specified speed.
</ul>
<pre>
	examples: 

	;$move 10,14
	;$move mountain (10,14)
	;$move Peghtmont
		MOVE NE NE NE NE NE NE NE N N ; 9 turns
		MOVE SW NW NW 1 IN NE ; 5 turns
	;$move 10,14,2 &lt;underworld&gt;
	;$move cavern (10,14,2 &lt;underworld&gt;)
		MOVE SE SW SW S ; 4 turns
	;$upkeep 2 ; will reduce silver count by 20 for a peasant.
	@;$travel ride ; do not warn about multi-turn move order
	@;$travel walk ; quite useful for livestock transports, or perhaps for horse-pulled wagons.

	One caravan:
	@TURN
	  give 123 all iron ;$checkzero stuff
	  give 123 all silv ;$move 4,4
	ENDTURN
	@TURN
	  take from 456 2000 silv ;$move 5,7
	ENDTURN

</pre>


<h4>Python enhancements</h4>
<a name="py_unit_filter"></a>
<h4>Python unit filters</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
	Both Python and conventional filters are supported.
	<li>
	When making conventional filter, corresponding Python filter is constructed in
	parallel to give some help.
	<li>
		Unit filter is a Python expression returning true or false, for example
		<pre>   SILV &lt; 0 </pre>
	<li>
	Filter is executed in the context of a unit. In other words, unit properties
	are global Python variables.
	<li>
		Python filters are more flexible, allowing to compare unit properties, for
		example. Consider the following filter
		<pre>   LEAD == 0 and SILV &gt; MEN*10*12 and (SWOR &gt;= MEN or XBOW &gt;= MEN) </pre>
		which returns all armed non-leader units having enough silv for a year. <a name="contacts">
		</a>
	<li>
		It is possible to use functionality in Python modules for processing filters.
		All required imports should be included in ah.common.py file. By default it
		imports only string module, which allows advanced string filtering. For example, the
		following filter will return all avoiding units: <br>
		<pre>   string.find(flags_standard, "a") >= 0</pre>
		<br>
</ul>
